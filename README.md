# The Battle of Neighborhoods

## Business problem

In this increasingly globalized world, the good use of digital tools for digital marketing campaigns is vital. But focusing on the small business, the location of the business is very important in order to be successful.

Many new businesses are not successful and are forced to close the blind because they have not done a proper market analysis, not selected potential customers and not selected the best location to open the business. Therefore, in this exercise we proceed to make an analysis to select an ideal location to open a pub in Madrid (Spain).
